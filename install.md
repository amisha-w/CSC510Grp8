## Download and Install Pip 

The PIP can be downloaded and installed using the command line by going through the following steps:
### Method 1: Using cURL in Python

Step 1: Open the cmd terminal

Step 2: In python, a curl is a tool for transferring data requests to and from a server. Use the following command to request:

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

    python get-pip.py
    
### Method 2: Manually install PIP on Windows

Pip must be manually installed on Windows. You might need to use the correct version of the file from pypa.org if youâ€™re using an earlier version of Python or pip. Get the file and save it to a folder on your PC.

Step 1: Download the get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) file and store it in the same directory as python is installed.

Step 2: Change the current path of the directory in the command line to the path of the directory where the above file exists. 

Step 3: get-pip.py is a bootstrapping script that enables users to install pip in Python environments. Run the command given below:

```
python get-pip.py
```

Step 4: Now wait through the installation process. Voila! pip is now installed on your system.

## Verification of the installation process

One can easily verify if the pip has been installed correctly by performing a version check on the same. Just go to the command line and execute the following command:

```
pip -V
or
pip --version
```
